# Big Peepee project 
Building this project in my spare time so don't judge. I ain't no expert :) 

## Tech stack 
I call it the big peepee stack - Golang, templ, htmx :) 
No slowy javascript (maybe later and htmx uses it but it is what it is)
Maybe some react for dynamic stuff - Big maybe but I don't think I will need it.
