Certainly! Let's walk through the typical flow of a purchase order and how the database will be queried at each stage.

1. Creating a Purchase Order:
   - A user creates a new purchase order by inserting a record into the `purchase_orders` table with the necessary details such as user ID, department ID, description, total amount, and initial status (e.g., "Pending").
   - The purchase order items are inserted into the `purchase_order_items` table, referencing the newly created purchase order ID.
   - Query example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO purchase_orders (user_id, department_id, description, total_amount, status)
     VALUES (1, 1, 'Office supplies', 500.00, 'Pending');
     
     INSERT INTO purchase_order_items (purchase_order_id, item_name, quantity, unit_price, total_price)
     VALUES (1, 'Printer paper', 10, 20.00, 200.00),
            (1, 'Ink cartridges', 5, 60.00, 300.00);
     ```

2. Department Admin Review:
   - The department admin retrieves the pending purchase orders for their department by joining the `purchase_orders` table with the `departments` table and filtering by the admin's department ID and the "Pending" status.
   - Query example:
     ```sql
     SELECT po.id, po.description, po.total_amount
     FROM purchase_orders po
     JOIN departments d ON po.department_id = d.id
     WHERE d.id = 1 AND po.status = 'Pending';
     ```
   - The department admin reviews the purchase order and updates its status in the `purchase_orders` table to either "Approved", "Declined", or "Sent Back for Adjustment".
   - An entry is added to the `purchase_order_approvals` table to record the approval action.
   - Query example:
     ```sql
     UPDATE purchase_orders
     SET status = 'Approved', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     WHERE id = 1;
     
     INSERT INTO purchase_order_approvals (purchase_order_id, approver_id, status)
     VALUES (1, 2, 'Approved');
     ```

3. Finance Team Review:
   - If the purchase order is approved by the department admin, it moves to the finance team for review.
   - The finance team retrieves the approved purchase orders by querying the `purchase_orders` table with the "Approved" status.
   - Query example:
     ```sql
     SELECT po.id, po.description, po.total_amount
     FROM purchase_orders po
     WHERE po.status = 'Approved';
     ```
   - The finance team reviews the purchase order and updates its status in the `purchase_orders` table to either "Approved", "Declined", or "Sent Back for Adjustment".
   - Another entry is added to the `purchase_order_approvals` table to record the finance team's approval action.
   - Query example:
     ```sql
     UPDATE purchase_orders
     SET status = 'Approved', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     WHERE id = 1;
     
     INSERT INTO purchase_order_approvals (purchase_order_id, approver_id, status)
     VALUES (1, 3, 'Approved');
     ```

4. Final Status:
   - Once the finance team approves the purchase order, its status is updated to "Approved" in the `purchase_orders` table.
   - If the purchase order is declined at any stage, its status is updated to "Declined".
   - If the purchase order is sent back for adjustment, its status is updated to "Sent Back for Adjustment", and the process starts again from the department admin review stage.

Throughout the process, you can query the `purchase_order_approvals` table to track the approval history and comments for each purchase order.

You can also join the `users` table to retrieve the names and details of the users involved in creating and approving the purchase orders.
